My e-portfolio was created as a way to let people know more about myself and the projects I have completed.
In a way this was the first real personal project I was able to work on from start to finish outside of school.

As I complete more projects and come up with other things to include I will update the page,
but as of 2025/09/06 the basics of the page have been completed

Please come back to see what else I end up creating in the future!!
